## Why

Many services in `services.xml` use string-based IDs (e.g., `setono_sylius_review.creator.review_request`) with a separate `class` attribute, instead of FQCN IDs which is the modern Symfony convention. FQCN IDs enable autowiring, improve IDE navigation, and reduce the gap between service config and code.

## What Changes

- **BREAKING**: Rename service IDs from string-based to FQCN for services where the class is unique (not two instances of the same class)
- Add interface aliases where interfaces exist, enabling type-hinted autowiring
- Services that cannot use FQCN (two instances of the same class, e.g., the two `CompositeAutoApprovalChecker` instances for store/product) keep their string IDs
- Services managed by Sylius resource bundle (repositories, factories) are not touched — those IDs are generated by Sylius
- Update all internal references (service arguments, compiler passes, tests) to use the new IDs

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

None.

### Modified Capabilities

None — this is a pure refactoring of service IDs with no behavioral changes.

## Impact

- **Code modified**: `src/Resources/config/services.xml`, `src/SetonoSyliusReviewPlugin.php`, `src/DependencyInjection/SetonoSyliusReviewExtension.php`, `tests/Functional/Creator/ReviewRequestCreatorTest.php`
- **Breaking for plugin users**: Anyone referencing the old string-based service IDs (e.g., decorating `setono_sylius_review.creator.review_request`) will need to update to the FQCN IDs
